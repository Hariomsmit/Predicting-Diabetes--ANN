# Predicting-Diabetes--ANN
In this project I have employed the python Keras library which is well known for deep learning applications. I have created this project to predict the diabetic patients using ANN - Artificial Neural Networks with an epochs of 300 and batch size of 50. Over all after training with ReLu activation I am able to achieve quite good accuracy of 85.29%. function
